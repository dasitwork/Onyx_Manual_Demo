The NX4 is a comprehensive feature packed control surface. With a well-arranged combination of motorized and manual faders as well as an array of playback button the NX4 offers 44 total playbacks in a compact yet extremely powerful package. As a member of the innovative ONYX platform from Obsidian Control Systems the NX4 is feature rich and never restricted in its capabilities. NX4 includes a high-brightness full HD multi-touch screen; 8 assignable parameter encoders; dedicated Intensity encoder; an assistive mini touch-screen; full keypad and command section and a dedicated grandmaster.

Two independent playback sections offer instant access. The main playback with 10 motorized faders plus 10 play-pairs allows for quick page changes while the sub playback with 12 faders and 12 button playbacks allows important cues to always be at the user’s fingertips.
