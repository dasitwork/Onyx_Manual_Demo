Range lock helps keep you within the \"sub-parameter\"\u00a0when a parameter has multiple functions.For example, some fixtures put the strobe function on the control channel. Range lock will keep you in strobe as you move the encoder, so that you don't accidentally reset the fixture! Percent/Digital toggle Toggles the display of raw DMX values between Percent and Digital. This option is also available in the Programmer Screen and will affect DMX value displays in the Programmer and the Fixture Parameter Screen. Relative/Absolute toggle This toggle determines how fixtures with different values for the same attribute will react with each other.For example, if we select fixtures 1 thru 5 and 1,2,4, and 5 are set at an intensity of 10% and fixture 3 is set at an intensity of 50%, when \u201crelative\u201d is selected, rolling up the intensity track belt will increase the intensity of the selected fixtures relative to one another.If the toggle is set to \u201cabsolute\u201d then all fixtures will jump to the level of the highest numbered fixture when the track belt is moved.This feature is particularly useful with the pan/tilt attributes however, please note that while it works well with the track belts, it does not function with the trackball Pan/Tilt Combo toggle This is an abbreviation for \u201cPan/Tilt Combine\u201d is used to separate pan and tilt when building FX.

We'll choose the Factory mask from folder 2 - Vid NoColor and press media content number 3:</p> <p></p> <p>Watch how the monochromatic \"mask\" is applied to the initial clip for a really cool output that has some great negative space!</p> <p>Select Effect 1 from the Zone Composer at the top and the bring the intensity of only the \"Effect 1\"\u00a0slot up and down:</p> <p></p> <p>Watch the mapping tab as well as the output on the master fixture as you do this. If you have lights attached or the Capture Visualizer demo file open, you'll see the changes live on your fixtures!</p> <p>RECORD this to a preset or cue, and have fun learning how to use DyLOS!</p> <p>As you work with the different steps in these examples, consider saving different parts of the tutorial onto different cues.</p> <p>For example, the Intensity of the Effect 1 could be saved to an Override type fader for a neat result, and highly flexible live control over this slot in DyLOS...</p> <p>Example 3: 2-Color Chase</p> <p>The 2-Color chase based your choice of preset colors has long been elusive in ONYX - no more!</p> <p>To begin, I\u00a0chose a Generator from the 2D\u00a0Shapes folder and applied it as the Source on one of my Zones:</p> <p></p> <p>Next, I\u00a0went to the \"Mapping\"\u00a0tab and chose the 2 Preset Mapping and selected (2)\u00a0presets from the Zone Parameters:</p> <p></p> <p>Which then gives me this result, with the colors fading between the 2 presets in accordance with the content:</p> <p></p> <p>Next, I\u00a0use the menu at the bottom of the Zone Parameters to toggle the \"Snap Mode\"\u00a0to Snap:</p> <p></p> <p>Which then gives me hard changes between my (2)\u00a0color palettes selected.</p> <p></p> <p>I\u00a0can RECORD this into a cue, and/or change presets, content, or any of the DyLOS\u00a0parameters on the fly in the programmer to change the look I\u00a0receive with just a few presses:</p> <p></p> <p>Example 4 - Generator Controlling Position and Intensity in a Single Zone</p> <p>Using the Opacity Mapping, we can create a DyLOS\u00a0cue that has only (1)\u00a0Zone but controls (2)\u00a0different parameters at the same time.</p> <ol> <li>We'll use the \"Stage\"\u00a0Zone in the demo showfile and create a Generator Source with the \"Matrix Lines\"\u00a0Generator on the default settings:</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Now, set the Source Opacity to 0%:</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>We'll now go Mapping tab to the select 2 Preset Mapping mode. For this example, I have Preset A set to \"DOWN 1\" and Preset B set to \"UP\u00a0EVEN\". All of the other settings are at their defaults:</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Now, we'll set the Opacity Mapping mode to \"Preset C\":</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Then choose the Intensity preset \"INT\u00a0@\u00a0100%\" and \"Alpha\"\u00a0from the Mapping key at the bottom. Changing the key to Alpha is very important because the Preset Mapping and Opacity mapping sections need to be using a different key for this example to work well. If they use the same key, you lose the 2 preset mode.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Now you'll get this result:</p> <p></p> <p>While a still image isn't as good as video, you can probably see that here we have a \"waterfall\"\u00a0type effect where the lights come on, transition from Preset A to Preset B, then turn off while they return to Preset A.</p> <p>But we can tweak the Opacity map at little further by using the Opacity Curve. For example, at the settings I currently have, the lights don't fade in and out as smoothly as I'd like.</p> <p>For the Opacity Curve, we select the Source sub-fixture and then go to the Beam Effects parameter group, and go to the 2nd page of Beam Effects parameters (FX5-8):</p> <p></p> <p>I then use these settings to smooth the intensity transition:</p> <p></p> <p>The best thing about this approach is that it can work with many of the generators and also a lot of the factory content with black backgrounds - these backgrounds turn transparent when the Zone Opacity is set to 0%!</p>"},{"location":"HTML%20import/DyLOS_Owner_Lock_and_Security.html","title":"DyLOS\u00a0Owner Lock and Security","text":"<p>In DyLOS, the Owner category of content is locked by a six-digit PIN and useable on any systems licensed LIVE (See ONYX\u00a0Licensing for more details on LIVE\u00a0and FREE\u00a0mode).</p>"},{"location":"HTML%20import/DyLOS_Owner_Lock_and_Security.html#dylos-owner-setup","title":"DyLOS\u00a0Owner Setup","text":"<p>Before you import any Owner content into DyLOS, you need to first setup an owner role.

Framing Upper Left X, Upper Left Y, Upper Right X, Upper Right Y, Lower Left X, Lower Left Y, Lower Right X, Lower Right Y The framing system of the entire DyLOS\u00a0canvas works similarly to many moving head lights. There are framing shutters that originate at the 4 sides of the zone. Each framing shutter has 2 points which can be fully adjusted from completely open to completely shut, allowing for very complex framing adjustments of the zone canvas.Framing is unique in regards to Opacity because any area outside of the framing shutters of the zone becomes transparent. This is independent of the opacity control of the zone, this only applies within the framing shutters:In the example above, you can see how there is transparency within the zone indicated by the \"boxes\"\u00a0and transparency outside of the framing shutters indicated by the \"diagonal lines\".The framing transparency is represented by a different shading because it is a framing of the entire canvas - when using a Zone at 0% opacity, the Color parameters will fill in the background of any \"boxes\" transparency within the canvas, but framing adjustments crop the entire canvas, leaving transparency through to the regular parameters:As you can see in this 2D\u00a0Plan preview, the transparency in the lower left side is turned to the background color, but the upper left is transparent to the regular parameters because it is transparent via Framing.

Grid view houses the buttons we use to select items such as Groups and Fixtures. The list view shows these items as well as their contents and other information. This will be explained in more detail later in the chapter. The Last button simply jumps backward to the previous fixture in your current fixture selection. The Next button simply jumps forward to the next fixture in your current fixture selection. The Highlight button will \"highlight\" fixtures that are selected. That is, it brings them (generally)\u00a0to full and open. If you wish, you can modify the highlight presets - the instructions are here. The Slice/Range toggle button is a very powerful function designed to work with multi-part fixtures such as a Color Chorus Batten, ACL 360 Matrix, or multi cell LED batten. It lets you select either a full range of the fixtures, or a partial sub range. See below for more information about Slice, The Grouping button is simply a shortcut to access the Grouping Tool feature as a pop-up within the window. The Deselect button will deselect any currently selected fixtures. This button is the equivalent of the [0] [ENTER] command. The Reselect button will simply reselect the last selected fixture selection. Its a useful function if you accidentally Deselected a complex fixture arrangement.

Follow the steps below to load a single attribute:</p> <ol> <li>With a cue running, select the group \u201cArtiste DaVinci\u201d on the Fixture Groups screen.</li> <li>Press the Intensity button in the Attribute Controls button section (if not already selected). Note that it is important to select the appropriate group before proceeding with the next step otherwise, the entire attribute group will be loaded, not the individual attribute.</li> <li>Press and hold the Load button.</li> <li>Press the hard button corresponding to the \"Intensity\" attribute on the screen, or press in the physical encoder wheel on a console.</li> <li>Release the Load button.</li> </ol> <p>You can also load individual parameters by right-clicking on the parameter button show on the encoders in the bottom right corner of the screen.</p> <p>Then press Load Channel.</p> <p></p> <p>The Programmer screen will then look similar to this:</p> <p></p> <p>You\u2019ll note that while the shutter attribute of the Intensity attribute group is still null, the intensity attribute has been loaded. Also loaded are the intensity FX values.</p> <p>These can either be cleared (see \u201c Clearing the Programmer \u201d) or hidden with the \u201cShow FX\u201d button at the top of the Programmer as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>While this hides the FX values, they are still in the Programmer and will still be recorded (unless filtered out in the options window of the relevant command). Note the small turquoise rectangle next to the fixture number indicating that there are hidden values in the Programmer.</p> <p>Using Load to Clone Fixture Values</p> <p>Aside from its usefulness in loading information into the Programmer, the Load function can also be used to copy information from one (or more) fixture(s) to one or more other fixtures. This process is known as \u201ccloning.\u201d Note: If you wish to clone all attributes of a certain fixture(s) to new fixture(s), it's generally easier to use the clone tool. Using Load to clone is helpful when you only want to clone certain attributes.</p> <p>When cloning, there are two types of fixtures: source and target.</p> <p>Source Fixture - This is a fixture loaded in the Programmer that contains the information you wish to clone to another fixture.</p> <p>Target Fixture - This is the fixture that you wish to have mimic the source fixture.</p> <p>Please note that the source fixture(s) must be loaded into the Programmer in order for it to be cloned.</p>"},{"location":"HTML%20import/Using_the_Load_Command.html#to-clone-a-fixture-to-another-fixture","title":"To Clone a Fixture to another Fixture","text":"<p>When cloning a fixture the syntax is Load xx @ yy Enter where xx is the target and yy is the source.
