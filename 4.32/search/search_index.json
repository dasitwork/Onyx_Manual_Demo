The introduction of SKIP cues and parameter release within cues gives you precision over tracking like never before. A new LTC Audio Timecode Input Processor expands synchronization options, while improved FADE/DELAY/WEIGHT editing streamlines programming.</p> <p>This update also introduces a brand-new weight system, allowing dynamic control over transitions by blending between direct cue and Dylos output per parameter. Additionally, new virtual gobo mapping unlocks advanced texture effects, and a dual fixture group mapping mask provides more flexible fixture control. Improved show backup naming ensures better organization, while AnyDesk remote support, expanded Focusrite ASIO driver compatibility, and numerous bug fixes enhance overall system stability.</p> <p>Discover the latest enhancements and take your show to the next level!</p>"},{"location":"index.html#feature-overview-video","title":"Feature Overview Video","text":""},{"location":"index.html#release-notes","title":"Release Notes","text":"<p>4.32.1307 (07/11/2025) /====================== ONYX-1261\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed DMX timings not showing on NX1 and NX2 ONYX-1258\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed not listening to Art-Net timecode after boot ONYX-1257\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed parameter window reverting to live values when editing highlight ONYX-1255\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed the highlight filter bug in the programmer windows ONYX-1254\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed list view not being scrollable when filling slightly more than one page ONYX-1245\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Additional hardware support ONYX-1256, ONYX-1253\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Minor fixes and improvements ONYX-1042\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Added support for NX W ONYX-1252\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed DyLOS not using very small ring-segment parts ONYX-1251\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed highlight values permanently edited after cloning ONYX-1248\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed audio error ONYX-1247\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed placing fixture multiple times on 2D plan page, causing pixel mapping problems ONYX-1246\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed faulty color tint parameters in legacy fixture types (causing show files not being able to load) ONYX-1244\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed UI becoming unresponsive or crashing when navigating complex views on multiple displays ONYX-1243\u00a0 \u00a0 Ignore updating fixture types that were previously enabled for virtual intensity, but are no longer eligible due to improvements in the AtlaBase translator (causing show files not being able to load) ONYX-1240\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed adding fixture groups to 2D plan while mirror is enabled ONYX-1234\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed exporting large patch reports on consoles ONYX-1233\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed the preparation of fixtures that only had (0%) intensity value recorded in mark cue ONYX-1231\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed FX wave/step size calculation when fan spread across mask steps is enabled ONYX-1230\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed fixture name not being visible on 2D plan when bright colors are assigned ONYX-1229\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed network interface enumeration issues on systems with MAC address pass-through enabled (assigning same MAC address to multiple interfaces) ONYX-1227\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed screen rotation issues when connecting/disconnecting external screens to NX2/NX4 consoles that run Windows 11 (IoT Enterprise) ONYX-1224\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed the \"new fixture\" wizard potentially causing fixture(s) to be created twice ONYX-1217\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fixed using physical encoders to set effect values for combined/linked channels, sometimes leaving FX wave and step calculations at zero ONYX-1213\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Improved NX-K &amp;
